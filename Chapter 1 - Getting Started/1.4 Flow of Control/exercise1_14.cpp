// Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. 
// Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

// For loops are commonly used when iterating over an array or when we have a fixed number of iterations.
// On the other hand, while loops are used when we can't determine the exact number of iterations
// or when we don't know for how long the expression used in the while loop will be true.
